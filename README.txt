# Quantum-IoRT: Decentralized Trust Orchestration Framework

A research framework for secure, decentralized orchestration of Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) networks. Implements quantum-resistant trust propagation, holographic storage, and neural-symbolic safety verification.

## Features

- Quantum-Inspired Trust Propagation: Resistance to quantum attacks with lattice-based cryptography
- Holographic Trust Storage: Fault-tolerant distributed storage inspired by holographic memory  
- Neural-Symbolic Safety Verification: Hybrid AI combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning
- Federated Anomaly Detection: Collaborative learning for adversarial pattern recognition
- Adaptive Safety Envelopes: Dynamic safety constraints based on network conditions
- Massive Scale Validation: Tested with 300+ heterogeneous nodes under adversarial conditions

## Experimental Results

- 92% Consensus Success Rate in decentralized coordination
- 89% F1-Score in adversarial detection  
- 88% Safety Compliance across all operations
- 15% Trust Improvement with quantum propagation vs traditional methods
- 3/3 Real-World Scenarios feasible (Smart Factory, Drone Swarm, Smart City)

## Quick Start

```python
from src.simulation.simulator import IoRTSimulation
from src.experiments.run_experiments import ExperimentRunner

# Initialize simulation
simulator = IoRTSimulation(nodes=300)
results = simulator.run_scenario('smart_factory')

# Run comprehensive experiments
runner = ExperimentRunner()
experimental_results = runner.run_all_experiments()
